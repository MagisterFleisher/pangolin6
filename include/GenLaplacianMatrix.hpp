 * Laplacian Matrix
 *
 * The sparsest cut of a graph can
 * be approximated through the
 * second smallest eigenvalue
 * of its Laplacian by Cheeger's inequality.  - Quoth the all knowing Wikipedea
 *
 * Kirchhoff Theorem:
 * The number of spanning trees of a graph
 * is the determinant of the Laplacian Matrix
 *
 * quivalently the number of spanning trees is equal to any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of G.
 * Kirchhoff's theorem can be generalized to count k component spanning forests in an unweighted graph
